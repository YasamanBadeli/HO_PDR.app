HO_DPR Dataset Analysis and API Application
Welcome to the HO_DPR Dataset Analysis and API Application, a professional project designed for an Algorithms course. This project uses FastAPI to build a RESTful API and Streamlit for an interactive user interface to analyze and predict patterns in the provided HO_DPR dataset. The project showcases the integration of web APIs, machine learning models, and data visualization.

Features
Interactive API:
Read predictions: Post structured inputs to receive predictions.
Homepage: A friendly introduction to the API.
Streamlit Dashboard:
Visualize the HO_DPR dataset interactively.
User-friendly interface with real-time charts and model insights.
Machine Learning:
Pre-trained machine learning model to generate predictions.
Requirements
Python >= 3.8
FastAPI
Uvicorn
Streamlit
Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
Pickle (for loading saved models and scalers)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HO_DPR-Project.git
cd HO_DPR-Project
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI Application:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Run the Streamlit Application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Usage
Start the FastAPI server to host the RESTful API.
Launch the Streamlit dashboard to explore the dataset and interact with model predictions.
Send POST requests to the /predict endpoint with structured inputs to receive model predictions.
